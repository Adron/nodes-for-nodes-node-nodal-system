# Nodes for Nodes Node Nodal System

## Description

This repository is for a [session](https://gotochgo.com/2018/sessions/368) at GOTO Chicago, but is the starting point to build a reference application for Node.js using key capabilities I advocate for as *patterns & practices* starting a new application, including: observability, ML/AI hooks, transparency, and operations of the application or service.

### Node Systems for Node.js Services on Nodes of Systemic Nodal Systems

Curious how Node.js is going to fit into the future environments with containerized deployments, management of those like Kubernetes, and how to get the most out of your Node.js Development paths? I'm going to take a look at a number of those, discuss what I've seen in industry, and what I've worked with just in the last few months. 

This talk will be broken into three specific topics:

1. Review: It's core purpose, original intent, and use within the industry.
2. The space it fits within new architecture paradigms today.
3. Node.js on Kubernetes Nodes working in Nodal Context.
